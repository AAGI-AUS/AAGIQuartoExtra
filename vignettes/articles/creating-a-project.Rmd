## Introduction

This article provides a guide on using the functions in the AAGIQuartoExtra package to create a structured project, manage folder organization, and work with Quarto documents effectively. There are five important steps we want to cover:

1. Create a new project.
2. Set up a structured folder hierarchy using `setup_folders()`.
3. Manage and organize Quarto reporting documents in the project with `setup_docs()`.
4. Use `download_fonts()` to obtain the Proxima Nova font and understand fallback mechanisms.
5. Set up Git and GitHub for version control.

## 1. Creating a new project

In RStudio, you can create a new AAGI Quarto document by clicking on `File -> New Project... -> New Directory -> AAGI Project`. This will create a new AAGI project with the basic structure and template files.

You will be prompted to enter the name of the project, the university partner, and the type of document you want to create (\**only **aagi-report** is available as of version 0.2.0*). The project will be created as a subdirectory in the specified working directory.

If you are familiar with projects environments, you also have the options to set `renv` and python virtual environments in the project.

When your AAGI project is created, you will notice that the new `index.qmd` file is created with the title of the project. This is the main document where you will write your content. You will notice that it includes some example content to get you started.

You can also open the `index.qmd` file in the Visual Editor by clicking on the `Visual` button in the RStudio toolbar. This will open the document in the Visual Editor where you can see a live preview of your document as you write.

If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to work and render AAGI Quarto reports in the created directory. Below, we will cover some additional functionalities that can help and facilitate the organisation of the project files.



## 2. Setting up a folder structure

When learning data analysis, it can be challenging to figure out how to organise files within the created project. It is good practice to establish a comprehensive file organisation structure that helps us to navigate and re-use the project content without losing a huge amount of time searching across lines of codes and files. 

We want to use structured projects that will help us understand how files are laid out weeks or months after weâ€™ve last worked on that project. One way is to create sub-folders for specific types of files, such as data, figures, function files, and documents. Using the `setup_folders()` function can help create a standardized folder hierarchy. This function organizes your project with the following folders:

- **data**: Contains raw data files used in the project (read-only).
- **code**: Contains R scripts for analysis and pre-processing.
- **figs**: Stores generated plots, tables, or figures.
- **doc**: Contains reports, manuscripts, or interim summaries.
- **output**: Holds processed data or logs created by scripts.
- **src**: Contains sourced scripts (e.g., helper functions).
- **admin**: For administrative files like project timelines or meeting notes.

To set up the proposed structure, just run:

```{r}
AAGIQuartoExtra::setup_folders()
```

You will see that the function will create the directories in your project root. You are free to remove/modify/add folders depending on your project requirements.



## 3. Managing Quarto documents

Based on the proposed structure, we should have all documents (e.g. PDF or DOCX files) stored within the /doc folder. The `setup_docs()` function helps organize your initial `index.qmd` and `_quarto.yml` files by renaming and updating their configuration. 

To use this function, simply run:

```{r}
AAGIQuartoExtra::setup_docs()
```

For instance, let's say we are working on a Wheat Nitrogen Response research project. The created project has been named `res_WheatNitrogenResponse`, so running the `setup_docs()` function will:

- Rename `index.qmd` to `01_WheatNitrogenResponse_Report.qmd`.
- Add the following entry to the `_quarto.yml` file:

```{yaml}
project:
  title: "res_WheatNitrogenResponse"
  type: default
  output-dir: doc
```

Now, clicking on `Build -> Render Project` in the RStudio toolbar will render the document to PDF and Word formats and save them in the `/doc` directory as `01_WheatNitrogenResponse_Report.pdf` and `01_WheatNitrogenResponse_Report.docx`. If everything is set up correctly, you should see rendered PDF and Word documents similar to these:

![](../media/figures/create_project_step6.png)

You should try to follow the naming convention for additional documents within the same project, for instance:

- `02_WheatNitrogenResponse_Manuscript.qmd`
- `03_WheatNitrogenResponse_ConferencePaper.qmd`
- `04_WheatNitrogenResponse_Slides.qmd`

The numbering system ensures clarity and logical ordering. Another possibility/recommendation is to include version number or dates written in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD).

## 4. Working with fonts

### Checking for Proxima Nova

The template uses the Proxima Nova font if available. If the font is not installed and you render any document, the package will fall back to Arial font. 

If you want to check if this font is installed, use:

```{r}
AAGIQuartoExtra::check_fonts()
```

### Downloading Proxima Nova Fonts

If you have access to the Proxima Nova font files within the private AAGI repository, you can use the `download_fonts()` function to retrieve and add them your project. This function:

1. Downloads the required `.otf` font files from the private GitHub repository.
2. Extracts the files into the `_extensions/aagi/fonts/` directory within your project.

While doing that, the function will automatically call `setup_github_pat()` to ensure you have the correct permissions to download from the repository. Run the following command to download the fonts:

```{r}
AAGIQuartoExtra::download_fonts()
```

If the fonts are downloaded successfully, the template will from now use Proxima Nova. If the download fails or the font is unavailable, Arial will continue to be used as the fallback.

## 5. Setting up Git and GitHub for version control

Version control is essential for managing changes and collaborating effectively in data analysis projects. You can set up Git and GitHub for your project using the `usethis` package. To configure Git for your project:

1. Open your R session and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the following commands:

```{r}
usethis::use_git()
```

This initializes a Git repository in your project directory.

To connect your project to a private GitHub repository, run:

```{r}
# If creating a GitHub repository in your personal account
usethis::use_github(private = TRUE)

# If creating a GitHub repository within the AAGI organisation
usethis::use_github(organisation = "AAGI-Org-AU", private = TRUE)
```

This will create a new private repository on GitHub and link it to your local project.

## Conclusion

This vignette has shown you how to create and structure a new project using `AAGIQuartoExtra`. For more details, consult the package documentation. 

Further work to improve functionality will involve:

- Adding support for other AAGIQuarto templates, such as short reports and presentations.
